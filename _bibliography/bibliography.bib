	abstract = {Understanding why researchers cite certain works remains a key question in the study of scientific networks. Prior research has identified factors such as relevance, group cohesion, and source crediting. However, the interplay between cognitive and social dimensions in citation behavior – often conceptualized as a socio-cognitive network – is frequently overlooked, particularly regarding the intermediary steps that lead to a citation. Since a citation first requires a work to be published by a set of authors, we examine how the structure of coauthorship networks influences citation patterns. To investigate this relationship, we analyze the citation and collaboration behavior of Chilean astronomers from 2013 to 2015 using the Group-Oriented Relational Hyperevent Model, which allows us to study coauthorship and citation networks in a joint framework. Our findings suggest that when selecting which works to cite, authors favor recent research and maintain cognitive continuity across cited works. At the same time, we observe that coherent groups – closely connected coauthors – tend to be co-cited more frequently in subsequent publications, reinforcing the interdependence of collaboration and citation networks.},

	abstract = {Governmental and nongovernmental organizations have increasingly relied on early-warning systems of conflict to support their decisionmaking. Predictions of war intensity as probability distributions prove closer to what policymakers need than point estimates, as they encompass useful representations of both the most likely outcome and the lower-probability risk that conflicts escalate catastrophically. Point-estimate predictions, by contrast, fail to represent the inherent uncertainty in the distribution of conflict fatalities. Yet, current early warning systems are preponderantly focused on providing point estimates, while efforts to forecast conflict fatalities as a probability distribution remain sparse. Building on the predecessor VIEWS competition, we organize a prediction challenge to encourage endeavours in this direction. We invite researchers across multiple disciplinary fields, from conflict studies to computer science, to forecast the number of fatalities in state-based armed conflicts, in the form of the UCDP ‘best’ estimates aggregated to two units of analysis (country-months and PRIO-GRID-months), with estimates of uncertainty. This article introduces the goal and motivation behind the prediction challenge, presents a set of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the forecasting models, describes the benchmark models which the contributions are evaluated against, and summarizes the salient features of the submitted contributions.}

	abstract = {Substantive research in the Social Sciences regularly investigates signed networks, where edges between actors are positive or negative. One often-studied example within International Relations for this type of network consists of countries that can cooperate with or fight against each other. These analyses often build on structural balance theory, one of the earliest and most prominent network theories. While the theorization and description of signed networks have made significant progress, the inferential study of link formation within them remains limited in the absence of appropriate statistical models. We fill this gap by proposing the Signed Exponential Random Graph Model (SERGM), extending the well-known Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to networks where ties are not binary but positive or negative if a tie exists. Since most networks are dynamically evolving systems, we specify the model for both cross-sectional and dynamic networks. Based on hypotheses derived from structural balance theory, we formulate interpretable signed network statistics, capturing dynamics such as “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”. In our empirical application, we use the SERGM to analyze cooperation and conflict between countries within the international state system. We find evidence for structural balance in International Relations.}

However, while economic theory extensively considers networks, no general framework for their empirical modeling has yet emerged. We thus introduce two different statistical models for this purpose – the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) and the Additive and Multiplicative Effects network model (AME). Both model classes can account for network interdependencies between observations, but differ in how they do so. The ERGM allows one to explicitly specify and test the influence of particular network structures, making it a natural choice if one is substantively interested in estimating endogenous network effects. In contrast, AME captures these effects by introducing actor-specific latent variables affecting their propensity to form ties. This makes the latter a good choice if the researcher is interested in capturing the effect of exogenous covariates on tie formation without having a specific theory on the endogenous dependence structures at play. After introducing the two model classes, we showcase them through real-world applications to networks stemming from international arms trade and foreign exchange activity. We further provide full replication materials to facilitate the adoption of these methods in empirical economic research.},

	abstract = {Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) have been successfully employed on numerous occasions to obtain vital data-driven insights. In this article we further substantiate the success story of GAMs, demonstrating their flexibility by focusing on three relevant pandemic-related issues. First, we examine the interdepency among infections in different age groups, concentrating on school children. In this context, we derive the setting under which parameter estimates are independent of the (unknown) case-detection ratio, which plays an important role in COVID-19 surveillance data. Second, we model the incidence of hospitalizations, for which data is only available with a temporal delay. We illustrate how correcting for this reporting delay through a nowcasting procedure can be naturally incorporated into the GAM framework as an offset term. Third, we propose a multinomial model for the weekly occupancy of intensive care units (ICU), where we distinguish between the number of COVID-19 patients, other patients and vacant beds. With these three examples, we aim to showcase the practical and ‘off-the-shelf’ applicability of GAMs to gain new insights from real-world data.},

	author={Cornelius Fritz and Marius Mehrl and Paul W. Thurner and Göran Kauermann},
	year={2023},
journal={Network Science},
abstract = { As relational event models are an increasingly popular model for studying relational structures, the reliability of large-scale event data collection becomes more and more important. Automated or human-coded events often suffer from non-negligible false-discovery rates in event identification. And most sensor data is primarily based on actors' spatial proximity for predefined time windows; hence, the observed events could relate either to a social relationship or random co-location. Both examples imply spurious events that may bias estimates and inference. We propose the Relational Event Model for Spurious Events (REMSE), an extension to existing approaches for interaction data. The model provides a flexible solution for modeling data while controlling for spurious events. Estimation of our model is carried out in an empirical Bayesian approach via data augmentation. Based on a simulation study, we investigate the properties of the estimation procedure. To demonstrate its usefulness in two distinct applications, we employ this model to combat events from the Syrian civil war and student co-location data. Results from the simulation and the applications identify the REMSE as a suitable approach to modeling relational event data in the presence of spurious events. },

	title={Combining Graph Neural Networks and Spatio-temporal Disease Models to Predict COVID-19 Cases in Germany},
	abstract = {During 2020, the infection rate of COVID-19 has been investigated by many scholars from different research fields. In this context, reliable and interpretable forecasts of disease incidents are a vital tool for policymakers to manage healthcare resources. In this context, several experts have called for the necessity to account for human mobility to explain the spread of COVID-19. Existing approaches often apply standard models of the respective research field, frequently restricting modeling possibilities. For instance, most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate unstructured data sources, including relational data that may encode human mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions by exploiting these data structures yet lack intuitive interpretability as they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a combination of both research directions and present a multimodal learning framework that amalgamates statistical regression and machine learning models for predicting local COVID-19 cases in Germany. Results and implications: the novel approach introduced enables the use of a richer collection of data types, including mobility flows and colocation probabilities, and yields the lowest mean squared error scores throughout the observational period in the reported benchmark study. The results corroborate that during most of the observational period more dispersed meeting patterns and a lower percentage of people staying put are associated with higher infection rates. Moreover, the analysis underpins the necessity of including mobility data and showcases the flexibility and interpretability of the proposed approach.},

	author={Ursula Berger and Cornelius Fritz and Göran Kauermann},
	abstract = {Aim of the study The aim of this was to study investigate the effectiveness of mandatory Covid-19 tests for in-classroom teaching in reopened schools as a containment measure in the pandemic. In Bavaria, mandatory testing at schools was implemented directly after the Easter vacations in 2021. For the first week after the vacations, this resulted in a natural experiment that allowed us to quantify the impact of the new testing strategy on reported Covid-19 cases.Methods We compared changes in the reported 7-day incidence of new infections between districts with in-classroom teaching at school and districts with closed schools. During the calendar week 15, districts with reported incidences below 100 were allowed to reopen schools and have in-classroom teaching if mandatory COVID-19 testing was performed at school with rapid antigen tests. We do not have data on the rapid test results; however, positive test results in the rapid antigen test were verified by a PCR test, and cases of positive PCR test results were reported at the district level by age groups. In the calendar weeks 13 and 14, all schools in Bavaria were closed due to Easter vacations. Taking into account a latency period of about 3–4 days and a reporting period of 1–2 days, this means that any additional increase in reported incidences for districts with in-class teaching and mandatory testing in the week after the vacation cannot be attributed to transmissions at schools, but reflects the reduction of underreporting due to the newly implemented testing strategy.Results Reported incidence increased by a factor of 6.6 for 5–11 year old and by 1.7 for 12–20 year old pupils in districts with in-classroom teaching and mandatory testing at schools. This increase was accompanied by a reduction in underreporting and was significant compared to districts with school closure. Given the situation of a natural experiment, this increase in the reported incidence among school children can be attributed to the testing strategy. For the same time period, no differences in reported incidences were found for the other age groups.Conclusion In-class teaching with mandatory testing in reopened schools changes the role of schools in the pandemic. Our analyses show that reopening schools with a mandatory testing approach is beneficial from an epidemiologic perspective as it can strongly reduce the dark figure of COVID-19 cases among children.},

While research has shown that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) had an evident impact on national mobility patterns, we investigate the relative regional mobility behaviour to assess the effect of human movement on the spread of COVID-19. In particular, we explore the impact of human mobility and social connectivity derived from Facebook activities on the weekly rate of new infections in Germany between March 3rd and June 22nd, 2020. Our results confirm that reduced social activity lowers the infection rate, accounting for regional and temporal patterns.

More precisely, we model the intensity of local armed conflict at a specific point in time as a three-stage process. Stages one and two of our approach estimate whether we will observe any casualties at the country- and grid-cell-level, respectively, while stage three applies a regression model for truncated data to predict the number of such fatalities conditional upon the previous two stages. Within this modeling framework, we focus on the role of governmental arms imports as a processual factor allowing governments to intensify or deter from fighting. We further argue that a grid cell’s geographic remoteness is bound to moderate the effects of these military buildups. Out-of-sample predictions corroborate the effectiveness of our parsimonious and theory-driven model, which enables full transparency combined with accuracy in the forecasting process.},

	Objective: Knowledge of cross-reactions in food-sensitive dogs will influence the choice of elimination diets and the long-term management of those patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate food allergen-specific IgE tests of suspected allergic dogs for concurrent positive reactions as possible evidence for cross reactions between allergens.
	
	Material and methods: Results of serum IgE tests from 760 suspected allergic dogs submitted to 2 laboratories were evaluated statistically. After the tested allergens were grouped by their phylogenetic relationship, odds ratios as well as a sensitivity analysis of the odds ratios were performed to evaluate if concurrent positive IgE results to 2 allergens occurred more often than expected.
	
	Results: Within related allergen pairs 27% (laboratory 1) and 72% (laboratory 2) of the pairs could be considered as associated. For the unrelated allergen pairs only 6.8% and 10.6% of the analyzed pairs were considered associated respectively. Strong correlations were shown in the group of ruminant allergens, especially beef and lamb, and grain allergens. High rates of concurrent reactions were also detected in the poultry group, especially between chicken and duck, as well as between pork and ruminant allergens, and soy and grain allergens.
	
	Conclusion: As our results showed not only correlations within related but also between non-related allergens, the possible relevance of carbohydrate moieties as well as panallergens for canine hypersensitivities warrants further study. Further investigations are necessary to distinguish co-sensitization from cross-reactions and determine the clinical relevance of food-specific IgE reactivity.
	
	Clinical relevance: Due to possible cross reactivity related allergens, especially beef and lamb as well as grain allergens, should not be used for an elimination diet to avoid false results.
