title = {Exponential Random Graph Models for Dynamic Signed Networks: An Application to International Relations},
keywords = {preprint},
abstract = { Substantive research in the Social Sciences regularly investigates signed networks, where edges between actors are either positive or negative. For instance, schoolchildren can be friends or rivals, just as countries can cooperate or fight each other. This research often builds on structural balance theory, one of the earliest and most prominent network theories, making signed networks one of the most frequently studied matters in social network analysis. While the theorization and description of signed networks have thus made significant progress, the inferential study of tie formation within them remains limited in the absence of appropriate statistical models. In this paper we fill this gap by proposing the Signed Exponential Random Graph Model (SERGM), extending the well-known Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to networks where ties are not binary but negative or positive if a tie exists. Since most networks are dynamically evolving systems, we specify the model for both cross-sectional and dynamic networks. Based on structural hypotheses derived from structural balance theory, we formulate interpretable signed network statistics, capturing dynamics such as "the enemy of my enemy is my friend". In our empirical application, we use the SERGM to analyze cooperation and conflict between countries within the international state system. },

title = {Modelling the large and dynamically growing bipartite network of German patents and inventors},
eprint={2201.09744},
abstraxt = {We analyse the bipartite dynamic network of inventors and patents registered within the main area of electrical engineering in Germany to explore the driving forces behind innovation. The data at hand leads to a bipartite network, where an edge between an inventor and a patent is present if the inventor is a co-owner of the respective patent. Since more than a hundred thousand patents were filed by similarly as many inventors during the observational period, this amounts to a massive bipartite network, too large to be analysed as a whole. Therefore, we decompose the bipartite network by utilising an essential characteristic of the network: most inventors tend to stay active only for a relatively short period, while new ones become active at each point in time. Consequently, the adjacency matrix carries several structural zeros. To accommodate for these, we propose a bipartite variant of the Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (TERGM) in which we let the actor set vary over time, differentiate between inventors that already submitted patents and those that did not, and account for pairwise statistics of inventors. Our results corroborate the hypotheses that inventor characteristics and knowledge flows play a crucial role in the dynamics of invention. },
