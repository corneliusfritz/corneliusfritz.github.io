It’s worth clarifying that each and every thought on this website is my own, I’m responsible for what I say, and all errors, stupid comments, and idiocy are my own personal responsibility. These are my own thoughts, generated by me, representing me. They – and this website – are in no way affiliated with ExperiencEconomy Ltd. or any other company that I have any involvement in. If I’ve made a mistake, it’s my fault. If something I wrote made you laugh, you can thank me. Obviously, you should not rely on anything in this website as legal, financial, accounting, investment, tax, or any other kind of regulated advice. I’m merely a gal who has a bunch of opinions, no matter how stupid they are.

My co-writers are incorporated herein 'by reference', which is legalese for “what they say is their own stuff and not affiliated with any of the companies they work for either.”

Oh, and good to note that this page is reviewed and revised from time to time.
