Hello! 

I am Cornelius Fritz and currently a PhD Student under G\"oran Kauermann working on all kinds of things remotely related to networks. My position is partly funded by the DFG project DFG Project ["International Arms Trade: A Network Approach"](https://www.arms-trade-research.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the  Munich Center for Machine Learning[(MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). In this context, my research mainly revolves around analyzing dynamic networks to answer questions posed within substantive sciences, e.g., Political Science and Sociology, by novel data analysis techniques that combine statistical and machine learning thinking. My current research interest are: 

-Dynamic Social Network Analysis 
-Relational Event Models
-Semiparametric Smoothing Methods  
-Scalable optimization and its Statistical Properties   
-Dynamic Modelling based on Markov Processes or Markov Chains 

Prior to this I received my B.Sc. and M.S.c degree in Statistics at the LMU Munich in 2016 and 2018. Now he is a Ph.D. student of G\"oran Kauermann at the LMU Munich funded by the \emph{Munich Center for Machine Learning} (MCML).
