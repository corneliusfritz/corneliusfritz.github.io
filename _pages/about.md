Hi everyone,

I am currently interim professor for Data Science at the LMU Munich. Before I was a Lecturer at the [Chair of Statistical Learning and Data Science](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/ruegamer/). I there lead the Subgroup [Classical Machine Learning](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/research/machine-learning.html) and [Deep Learning](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/research/deep-learning.html). Before I worked in the [Biostatistics Working Group](https://www.biostat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) led by Prof. Dr. Greven, were I was partly funded by the [Emmy Noether project 'Statistical Methods for Longitudinal Functional Data'](https://www.biostat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/forschung/emmy_noether_pup/index.html). I am also part of the organizing team [Applied R Munich](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Applied-R-Munich/) and (co-)author of several R packages (see Software section or [my github profile](https://github.com/davidruegamer)).

My current research involves the development of uncertainty quantification approaches for statistical and machine learning models and unification of concepts from statistics and deep learning.
