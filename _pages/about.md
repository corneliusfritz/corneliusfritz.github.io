Hi!

I am Cornelius Fritz, a postdoctoral fellow at Penn State working with [Michael Schweinberger](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/mus47) and [David Hunter](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/drh20) on network models under local dependence. Before that, I was the interim professor of Data Science at [LMU](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html). I obtained my Ph.D. student in statistics under the supervision of [GÃ¶ran Kauermann](https://www.en.wisostat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/lehrstuhlinhaber/kauermann/index.html). My research was partially funded by the DFG project DFG Project ["International Arms Trade: A Network Approach"](https://www.arms-trade-research.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the Munich Center for Machine Learning [(MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). <br>

Smart devices collecting interpersonal data surround us at every move and facilitate novel ways of measuring and understanding social behavior. The collected data provide planetary-scale views of online interpersonal relations, allowing a more nuanced look at bias in information diffusion, polarization, and echo chamber effects. In my research, I use statistics to learn from such network data to answer questions posed within the social sciences in uncertain and changing environments. <br>

My research mainly originates from multidisciplinary collaborations with social scientists approaching me with data and questions revolving around networks. As a statistician, I operate in two worlds: the *real* world, which encompasses observed data with all its imperfections and substantive knowledge of the subject matter, and the *model* world, which is an artificial representation of the *real* world characterized by a stochastic model. I develop novel data analysis techniques by combining statistical and machine learning with substantive theory to bridge the gap between the *real* and *model* world.

If you have any questions on some of my papers, want to discuss some research topic, or just want to get in touch, you can best reach me via mail [mail](mailto:cfritz@psu.edu) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cornelius_fritz).
