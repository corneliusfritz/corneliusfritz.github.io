Hello! 

I am Cornelius Fritz and will be the interim professor of Data Science at [LMU](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html) starting October 2022. Before that I was a Ph.D. student in statistics under the supervision of [GÃ¶ran Kauermann](https://www.en.wisostat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/lehrstuhlinhaber/kauermann/index.html). My position was partially funded by the DFG project DFG Project ["International Arms Trade: A Network Approach"](https://www.arms-trade-research.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the  Munich Center for Machine Learning [(MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). <br>

My research mainly revolves around analyzing dynamic networks to answer questions posed within substantive sciences, e.g., Political Science and Sociology, through novel data analysis techniques that combine statistical and machine learning thinking. I was also an active member of the [CODAG](https://www.covid19.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) (COVID-19 Data Analysis Group),  researching the interplay of mobility patterns and COVID-19 infections as well as as well as supporting other projects. <br>

If you have any questions on some of my papers, want to discuss some research topic, or just want to get in touch, you can best reach me via mail
[mail](maiat:cornelius.fritz@stat.uni-muenchen.de) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cornelius_fritz).
