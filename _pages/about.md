Hello! 

I am Cornelius Fritz and currently a PhD Student under GÃ¶ran Kauermann working on all kinds of things remotely related to networks. My position is partly funded by the DFG project DFG Project ["International Arms Trade: A Network Approach"](https://www.arms-trade-research.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the  Munich Center for Machine Learning[(MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). <br>

In this context, my research mainly revolves around analyzing dynamic networks to answer questions posed within substantive sciences, e.g., Political Science and Sociology, by novel data analysis techniques that combine statistical and machine learning thinking. I am also an active member of the [CODAG](https://www.covid19.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) (COVID-19 Data Analysis Group), where I am doing research on the interplay of mobility patterns and COVID-19 infections as well as other smaller projects. <br>

Prior to this I received my B.Sc. and M.S.c degree in Statistics at the LMU Munich in 2016 and 2018.
