abstract = {Since the primary mode of respiratory virus transmission is person-to-person interaction, we are required to reconsider physical interaction patterns to mitigate the number of people infected with COVID-19. While research has shown that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) had an evident impact on national mobility patterns, we investigate the relative regional mobility behaviour to assess the effect of human movement on the spread of COVID-19. In particular, we explore the impact of human mobility and social connectivity derived from Facebook activities on the weekly rate of new infections in Germany between March 3rd and June 22nd, 2020. Our results confirm that reduced social activity lowers the infection rate, accounting for regional and temporal patterns. The extent of social distancing, quantified by the percentage of people staying put within a federal administrative district, has an overall negative effect on the incidence of infections. Additionally, our results show spatial infection patterns based on geographic as well as social distances.},

@article{Fritz2020a,
abstract = {We propose a novel tie-oriented model for longitudinal event network data. The generating mechanism is assumed to be a multivariate Poisson process that governs the onset and repetition of yearly observed events with two separate intensity functions. We apply the model to a network obtained from the yearly dyadic number of international deliveries of combat aircraft trades between 1950 and 2017. Based on the trade gravity approach, we identify economic and political factors impeding or promoting the number of transfers. Extensive dynamics as well as country heterogeneities require the specification of semiparametric time-varying effects as well as random effects. Our findings reveal strong heterogeneous as well as time-varying effects of endogenous and exogenous covariates on the onset and repetition of aircraft trade events.},
