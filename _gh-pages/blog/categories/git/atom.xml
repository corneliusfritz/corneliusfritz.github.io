    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before I joined Artsy, I worked at companies where software projects tended to have meaningful, predictable names. If we were building a system for flagging media uploads, it might be called <code>media-review</code>. In many cases, our code repositories' names matched the main product's branding or even the company's name. Life was simple and there was no risk of ambiguity.</p>

<p>At Artsy, our systems have peculiar code names like <em>Gravity</em>, <em>Pulse</em>, and <em>Vortex</em>. There's a persistent learning curve as you contribute to different repositories or as new services get created. Numerous times, I've wondered: are code names worth the trouble?</p>

<p>To be clear, <em>any</em> project naming scheme works in small quantities. Personal projects or libraries for public release should probably just be named for clarity and find-ability. Code names start to offer benefits as a team grows and a product evolves over the longer term:</p>

<p>Code names embrace that <strong>we don't necessarily know the fit or scope of a system when it's first conceived</strong>. To <em>not</em> employ code names would require accurately predicting a system's eventual function. A project named <code>artsy-admin</code> starts to grate when we make the architectural decision to split apart management utilities or introduce more fine-grained administrative roles. An <code>artwork-taxonomy</code> label loses meaning when that system expands to include less structured tags</p>

<p><strong>Branding shifts, products pivot, and companies merge.</strong> Project code names introduce a level of indirection between what engineers build and the labels, URLs, or brands that end users experience. Over a long enough period, these external or superficial changes <em>will</em> happen and risk introducing confusion or just subtle misalignment between form and function. As with software design in general, abstractions can be a powerful tool to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separate concerns</a>. Ask yourself: what code changes might be required if your company were to spin off your product or be merged into an acquirer?</p>

<p><strong>Language is important</strong>, and not just for communication but for shaping our thoughts and assumptions. We frequently find ourselves debating which system should serve as the authority for a given domain model or where to implement a new feature, and project names that overlap with these topics (e.g., <code>search</code>, <code>images</code>, <code>suggestions</code>) would predispose us to certain decisions. Code names free us to focus on the architectural and organizational merits instead.</p>

<p>We like to <strong>have fun at work</strong> and it's more joyful to proclaim that "Torque is in the wild" than "data-sync has been deployed." Over time these names gain mythologies and personalities within the team and organization.</p>

<p>With this in mind, how should you choose a naming scheme?</p>

<a name="Rules.for.a.project.naming.scheme"></a>
<h2>Rules for a project naming scheme</h2>

<ul>
<li>Avoid implicit value judgments like "new," "next," or "modern." We've all witnessed today's hot project become next year's unloved albatross.</li>
<li>Choose a code name scheme that isn't directly related to your technology or business. A flower business using flower names is cute, but breaks down when you want to build a feature that <em>actually</em> is about tulips.</li>
<li>Everyone should be able to participate, so avoid industry lingo or obscure terminology. Funny story: I work at an art start-up but don't know enough artists to name my projects that way. I struggle even more to pronounce the few projects that are.</li>
<li>There should be lots of choices. You'll regret choosing to name your projects after "decathlon sports" or "days of the week" when your team inevitably transitions to microservices.</li>
<li>Names should be unique within a company and--ideally--beyond the company's scope. You wouldn't want your <code>marketing-site</code> repository to conflict with a contributor's <code>marketing-site</code> repository from another organization. Github projects, S3 buckets, Heroku application names, and published libraries all benefit from being globally unique.</li>
<li>Bonus points for choosing a rich enough scheme that names can subtly relate to each system's function. At Artsy, we use physics terms for code names, so our e-commerce back-end is called <a href="https://github.com/artsy/exchange">Exchange</a> and a command line utility for developers is called <a href="https://github.com/artsy/momentum">Momentum</a>. A shipping service might be called <em>Weight</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Example code name schemes: animals, movies, sea creatures, cartoon/TV characters, woodworking tools, celebrities (but get legal advice before borrowing living individuals' names). <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames">Ubuntu</a> gets extra mileage by combining adjectives with animal names. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_codenames">Apple</a> has used wine, cats, and California geography. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29">Google</a> likes dessert.</p>

<a name="Finally"></a>
<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>These days, I've embraced Artsy's use of physics terms for project names. There continues to be some head-scratching as new engineers navigate codebases and encounter these terms or just struggle to identify the system responsible for a given site or feature. (This isn't shocking, since code names were probably adapted from more secretive environments like the military.) As your code names multiply and projects come and go, a glossary becomes essential. I suggest creating a simple document that maps projects' code names to descriptions, URL destinations, hosting environments, and teams.</p>

    <id>https://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/10/26/Git-Reverts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don’t revert code changes often. Usually, I’m a fan of "rolling forward" with a fix, rather than rolling back. But sometimes, revert-and-fix is just the ticket. I had to do so recently, and it brought up some interesting challenges, so I thought I’d share.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here’s the scenario. Some recent changes I was making to Gravity, our core API service, had a pretty big ripple effect. Gravity is a big app, with over 100k LOC, so the tests take a long time to run. For this reason, we have our CI server set up to only run the tests it thinks are applicable for the changes in each commit in a pull request. That way, we can get pretty fast feedback on individual commits. But because Ruby is dynamic, the detection of which tests to run is imperfect. So, we run all the tests when a PR is merged to <code>master</code>, as a blocking step before the changes are actually deployed to our staging environment.</p>

<p>This makes it possible to “break the build”, where the <code>master</code> branch no longer is valid with respect to its tests, which is exactly what happened. The staging build of my changes failed, and it rendered our whole team unable to ship changes until the build was fixed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Eek!</p></blockquote>

<p>No big deal, that’s what reverts are for, and GitHub makes it quite easy to revert a pull request. If nobody merged anything to <code>master</code> that required conflict resolution with the changes in your PR, you can pretty much painlessly and immediately revert. Which I did.</p>

<blockquote><p>Great!</p></blockquote>

<p>Now I had time to fix those tests, without worrying about blocking anyone. I checked out the original branch and pretty quickly figured out what changes I needed to make to fix the tests. Then I pushed that branch up to origin to make a new PR.</p>

<blockquote><p>Drat! Merge conflicts. Right, I need to either merge or rebase from <code>master</code> to get everything up-to-date.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that’s when I hit the problem. Now that I had reverted my original changes, those <em>undos</em> are considered the canonical history, rather than the original changes I had tried to make! So both <code>git merge master</code> and <code>git rebase master</code> left me with only the tiny fixes to the failing tests, but my actual meaningful changes still removed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Conundrum.</p></blockquote>

<p>The solution I came up with was to <em>revert my revert</em>. The PR that the original revert button created also presented a revert button after it was merged. So I hit that button, and it created an amusingly titled <code>Revert "Revert “My original title””</code>. I <code>git stash</code>d my fixes, <code>git fetch</code>d the branch GitHub created for this newest PR down to my local, and <code>git checkout</code>d the this branch. This effectively was my original changes on top of their rollback, on top of those same changes — crucially, with changes other developers had made in the meantime mixed in there somewhere. I then <code>git stash pop</code>d my fixes.</p>

<blockquote><p>Phew!</p></blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, rolling back presents some interesting challenges, in the context of how Git considers history. If I've messed up a local branch, I might just give up and <code>git reset --hard</code> to get it back to a known good commit. But when it comes to the <code>master</code> branch, you have to be able to wiggle your way out of tricky situations. GitHub’s reverts are a viable option for keeping the <em>history</em> rolling forward as you undo and redo work.</p>
