    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Email! Electronic mail! What a concept! Like many companies, Artsy has built products on top of email, but this is
a decision that (like many companies) Artsy periodically regrets. But overall, our email systems work well!</p>

<p>But what about when it doesn't? Well that's what today's blog post is about: what happens when things break and you
don't know why?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have learned a lot
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/05/30/my-first-week-on-call/">since my first on-call shift</a>, but going on call
still gives me a little stage fright. As I start a shift, I'm on the look-out for things that might break, and soon
after starting a recent on-call shift, "breaking" is exactly what things did.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-07-diagnosing-our-radiation-problems/alert.png" alt="Screenshot of Slack alert" /></p>

<p>We got an automated alert on Slack that one of our email services, code-named "Radiation", had really high response
times. We <em>then</em> received an alert that too many requests to Radiation were failing completely. Yikes. The next
twenty two hours was a deep dive into Heroku, New Relic, Rails, and PostgreSQL, all to isolate the problem and
produce a solution.</p>

<p>The nice thing about email, as a protocol, is that it's based on a store-and-forward concept. That means that if a
message delivery fails, email servers will try again later (typically with an exponential backoff). SendGrid, our
email processor, has built their REST API around this same store-and-forward concept. While the Radiation server
was unresponsive, SendGrid wouldn't receive successful HTTP responses from the webhook deliveries, so it would
attempt to re-deliver the failing emails later. Email deliveries would be delayed, but the emails themselves would
not be dropped. We wasted no time addressing the problem, but we were also confident that once we fixed the issue,
the data would be okay.</p>

<p>After the alert, Ashkan (Radiation's point-person) and I communicated with our colleagues (engineers and affected
non-engineers) about the problem. With the help of Chung-Yi, we began investigating the immediate problem (with a
focus on <em>mitigating</em> it, rather than necessarily <em>fixing</em> it). Oh, we tried it all: spinning up more Heroku Dynos
to handle requests, increasing concurrency on the individual Dynos, restarting Redis and PostgreSQL stores. Each
time, things would work briefly before the Radiation API would begin timing out again. More accurately, the
requests sent to Radiation were taking longer than the Heroku router was giving them (30 seconds) before the router
gave up and timed out the request. We started examining the Radiation code and database (keeping our <em>ion the
prize</em>: mitigation).</p>

<p>Ashkan investigated slow database queries. We added new PostgreSQL indexes to speed up queries, and restructured
others to avoid expensive joins. Unfortunately, all this accomplished was extending the time after a Dyno reboot
that things would work (before beginning to timeout again). Because
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/05/30/database-encryption/">Artsy stores emails as encrypted-at-rest</a>, it was
difficult to pinpoint which exact message could be causing the timeouts. And Radiation itself didn't have much in
the way of logging, which would normally help us debug the problem.</p>

<p>It was frustrating to try to fix something but only manage to improve how long it took to break again. We had
enhanced Radiation's performance to the point where it was taking 10 minutes after a Dyno reboot to begin timing
out again, up from 30 seconds at the beginning of the incident. Despite an afternoon and evening spent trying to
fix the problem, we were stuck. We decided that the best course of action was a good night's sleep; we would ask
for help in the morning.</p>

<p>The next day, Ashkan and I got <em>up and atom</em> to address the problem. We brought my on-call partner Devon up to
speed, detailing the incident symptoms and what we had tried so far. While Devon and Ashkan worked on additional
logging and new timeout strategies, I took another approach.</p>

<p>Artsy has been moving to <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com">DataDog</a> for server performance monitoring, but Radiation was
still using <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a>. My background is in iOS app development and I had never really dug
into New Relic before, but I <em>am</em> very experienced at profiling iOS applications, and the Ruby and Objective-C
runtimes have more in common than they have have differences. I used New Relic to profile a production Radiation
Dyno for five minutes and, to our collective surprise, we found that more than 90% of CPU time was being spent in
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/blob/ff2ad16949bf5190f93df1a3e83eb0192f136c6d/app/controllers/griddler/emails_controller.rb#L4-L10">an innocuous function of a dependency</a>,
the open source library <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler">Griddler</a>.</p>

<p>Artsy uses Griddler to parse and sanitize emails that we receive from <a href="https://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a>. Griddler
contained the problematic code, which was responsible for parsing email responses from threaded replies. So if an
email body received by Radiation looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>This is the most recent reply in this email conversation.

On September 28th, 2019, Someone Else Wrote:

[The rest of the email thread]
</code></pre>

<p>Then Griddler parses out the string "This is the most recent reply in this email conversation." for Radiation to
process. This is really important because some of the threads in Radiation are <em>thousands</em> of emails long. In fact,
I learned that Radiation has Artsy's largest production database.</p>

<p>Griddler does this processing via regular expressions. Ashkan had the insight to look for existing issues from
other Griddler users who ran into similar problems, and to our delight,
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/pull/310">we found a pull request</a> that appeared to address the <em>exact</em>
issue that we were having.</p>

<p>It turns out that emails with large amounts of repeated newline characters would totally stall Griddler's regex.
Heroku's router would timeout any request after 30 seconds, but would leave the Ruby code churning on that regex.
That would leave the Rails server unable to respond to subsequent HTTP requests, causing more timeouts. And because
of email's store-and-forward nature, SendGrid would begin sending more problematic emails pretty quickly after any
Radiation reboot. A small change to add a regex group was all that was necessary to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Phew! We forked Griddler to Artsy's GitHub organization and applied the change from the pull request. We were
concerned about security implications of using a different regex, but my
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/02/06/apogee-technical-retrospective/">previous work in regular expressions</a>
helped me vet the change. We pointed Radiation's Gemfile to Artsy's fork and deployed the change.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-07-diagnosing-our-radiation-problems/heroku.png" alt="Screenshot of Heroku Dashboard, indicating a drop in load" /></p>

<p>Then, we waited. Would the system start timing out again? It took a half hour for any of us to breathe a sigh of
relief. But things appeared to be stable: response times were normal and Dyno load dropped precipitously. Our
<em>Curie</em> worked. (Okay, enough radiation puns.)</p>

<p>During our weekly incident review, Devon guided the rest of our team through our incident response and what we
learned. Radiation is now in a much better state, so that future problems will be easier to track down. We
responded to the Griddler pull request, encouraging the maintainers to merge the commit so other teams would avoid
this problem. The incident review meeting explored a number of options to mitigate future issues, including
migrating Radiation to our Kubernetes cluster, and Sam (our VP of Engineering) suggested writing this post. So here
we are.</p>

<p>Ashkan also followed up with peer feedback for Devon, Chung-Yi, and myself. In part, it read:</p>

<blockquote><p>It's rare and odd to say dealing with incident was fun, but with your help it actually was productive and fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which, honestly? One of my proudest accomplishments at Artsy.</p>

<p>In the end, we solved the problem and restored access to our email systems in under 24 hours. We kept our cool, we
communicated effectively with our non-engineering colleagues, and we learned a lot. What more could you want from a
Radiation incident?</p>

    <link href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/05/30/database-encryption/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-30T11:03:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>https://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/05/30/database-encryption</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After examining the data stored in one of our high-throughput systems, we realized it might include sensitive user data. To reduce the number of people that are technically able to access the data and reduce the risks associated with a potential data theft, we decided to encrypt certain database fields.</p>

<a name="Our.Goal"></a>
<h1>Our Goal</h1>

<p>Encrypt sensitive fields without any downtime.</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Approach"></a>
<h1>Approach</h1>

<p>While we wanted to encrypt existing rows, new rows were constantly being added. In order to achieve zero downtown we have devised the following path:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add new <em>encrypted</em> fields to the database.</li>
<li>Start populating new <em>encrypted</em> fields with <em>encrypted</em> values while still populating <em>un-encrypted</em> fields.</li>
<li>In the background, migrate existing records by populating their <em>encrypted</em> fields.</li>
<li>Refactor to use <em>encrypted</em> fields.</li>
<li>Drop <em>un-encrypted</em> fields.</li>
</ol>


<p>Each step above was relatively simple and was tested properly before moving to the next step.</p>

<a name="Choosing.an.Encryption.Library"></a>
<h2>Choosing an Encryption Library</h2>

<p>We looked at a few gems, mainly <a href="https://github.com/attr-encrypted/attr_encrypted">attr_encrypted</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jmazzi/crypt_keeper">crypt_keeper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rocketjob/symmetric-encryption">symmetric-encryption</a>.</p>

<p>While all these libraries were reliable, we used <a href="https://github.com/rocketjob/symmetric-encryption">symmetric-encryption</a>, based on its robust <a href="https://rocketjob.github.io/symmetric-encryption/">documentation</a>, ease of use and easy integration with other libraries (in our case <code>ActiveRecord</code>). It provides some useful <a href="https://rocketjob.github.io/symmetric-encryption/rake_tasks.html">Rake tasks</a> for configurations inside/outside of Heroku. Overall <code>symmetric-encryption</code> seemed really 🔒 .</p>

<a name="Configuration"></a>
<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The <code>config/symmetric-encryption.yml</code> file is used to define what algorithm to use and where to find the related keys for different environments.</p>

<p>Symmetric Encryption uses OpenSSL to encrypt and decrypt the data which means we are able to use any of the algorithms supported by OpenSSL. We used <code>aes-256-cbc</code> which is also the recommended default algorithm.</p>

<p>In order to create a new set of keys:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">rails generate symmetric_encryption:new_keys production
</code></pre>

<p>Above command will create an encryption key and an Initialization Vector (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector">IV</a>). Generated key <strong>must not</strong> be committed into source code. Depending on how your application is deployed, there are two approaches for storing this key. In both scenarios encryption keys are encrypted before storing on file/environment variable. Secret used for encrypting the encryption key itself can be committed into source code.</p>

<p>To access sensitive data, a malicious party would require access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>The database,</li>
<li>Our source code,</li>
<li>Encryption keys from files or configuration</li>
</ul>


<a name="Outside.of.Heroku"></a>
<h3>Outside of Heroku</h3>

<p>Key can be stored in a file on disk outside of source code. We can use <code>key_filename</code> in configuration <code>yml</code> to point to this file. In this scenario we would use the operating system to limit access to key file.</p>

<p>Here is a sample configuration file:</p>

<pre><code class="yml">#config/symmetric_encryption.yml


production:
  # Since the key to encrypt and decrypt with must NOT be stored along with the
  # source code, we only hold a RSA key that is used to unlock the file
  # containing the actual symmetric encryption key
  #
  # Sample RSA Key, DO NOT use this RSA key, generate a new one using
  #    openssl genrsa 2048
  private_rsa_key: |
     -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
     MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAxIL9H/jYUGpA38v6PowRSRJEo3aNVXULNM....
     r1URaMAun2PfAB4g2N/kEZTExgeOGqXjFhvvjdzl97ux2cTyZhaTXg==
     -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

  # List Symmetric Key files in the order of current / latest first
  ciphers:
     -
        # Filename containing Symmetric Encryption Key encrypted using the
        # RSA public key derived from the private key above
        key_filename: /etc/rails/.rails.key
        iv_filename:  /etc/rails/.rails.iv

        # Encryption cipher_name
        #   Recommended values:
        #      aes-256-cbc
        #         256 AES CBC Algorithm. Very strong
        #         Ruby 1.8.7 MRI Approximately 100,000 encryptions or decryptions per second
        #         JRuby 1.6.7 with Ruby 1.8.7 Approximately 22,000 encryptions or decryptions per second
        #      aes-128-cbc
        #         128 AES CBC Algorithm. Less strong.
        #         Ruby 1.8.7 MRI Approximately 100,000 encryptions or decryptions per second
        #         JRuby 1.6.7 with Ruby 1.8.7 Approximately 22,000 encryptions or decryptions per second
        cipher_name:  aes-256-cbc
</code></pre>

<a name="On.Heroku"></a>
<h3>On Heroku</h3>

<p>Since the filesystem on Heroku is <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem">ephemeral</a>, <code>symmetric-encryption</code> suggests to set encryption key as an environment variable. Configuration is same as above except we replace <code>key_filename</code> with <code>encrypted_key: "&lt;%= ENV['PRODUCTION_ENCRYPTION_KEY1'] %&gt;"</code>.</p>

<p>You can use the following rake task to generate a Heroku-specific configuration file:
<code>
rails g symmetric_encryption:heroku_config
</code>
This creates a <code>config/symmetric-encryption.yml</code> file and also outputs commands you can run to set the <em>encrypted</em> encryption key on Heroku as an environment variable.</p>

<a name="ActiveRecord.Integration"></a>
<h3>ActiveRecord Integration</h3>

<p>Symmetric Encryption provides a seamless integration with <code>ActiveRecord</code>. We can use <code>attr_encrypted</code> helper method to define <em>encrypted</em> fields. Let's say we wanted to encrypt a <code>Note</code> model that has <code>note</code> and <code>subject</code>. You can add the following to your <code>ActiveRecord</code> model:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># app/models/note.rb
attr_encrypted :note
attr_encrypted :subject
</code></pre>

<p>This means whenever you set <code>note</code> for this model <code>symmetric-encryption</code> will set <code>encrypted_note</code> field in the database. Whenever you retrieve an instance of this model, <code>symmetric-encryption</code> will decrypt <code>encrypted_note</code> field and you can access <em>decrypted</em> value by just accessing <code>note</code>.</p>

<p>In our case we couldn't use this helper immediately. Using encrypted_attr would prevent us from directly accessing the existing, un-encrypted fields in our database (which is necessary through step 3 in our approach). To work around this, we started by adding a <code>before_validation</code> callback to our model to set encrypted fields based on un-encrypted ones.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># app/models/note.rb
before_validation :encrypt_notes_fields

def encrypt_note_fields
  self.encrypted_note = SymmetricEncryption.encrypt(note, true, true, :string)
  self.encrypted_subject = SymmetricEncryption.encrypt(subject, true, true, :string)
end
</code></pre>

<p>In the above code <code>SymmetricEncryption.encrypt(note, true, true, :string)</code> means encrypt <code>note</code> field, use random IV(Initialization Vector), compress the string and also use string when decrypting.</p>

<p>Once we got to the 4th step and stopped populating/reading un-encrypted fields we can easily switch above to</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># app/models/note.rb
attr_encrypted :note
attr_encrypted :subject
</code></pre>

<a name="Query.encrypted.fields"></a>
<h1>Query encrypted fields</h1>

<p>Generally when we encrypt a field we can't do a partial query on the content of that field. On the other hand if we use the same IV each time we encrypt a value, we can do an exact match query. Using same IV means encrypting the same value always end up with the same encrypted string. If exact match query is not something you need, the recommended approach is to use random IV for each encryption.</p>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>With this approach we were able to encrypt a database with ~1.5 million rows without any downtime in about a week.</p>
