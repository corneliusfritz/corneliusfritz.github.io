          <p>Good team culture strives for cohesion. Once organizations get large enough, a tension emerges between the culture
of individual teams and the culture of the larger organization. How do you achieve team cohesion across small teams
<em>and</em> the larger organizations they comprise?</p>

<p>The culture at Artsy is driven by every team member, not mandated or handed down from above. This adds another
level of tension, between individuals and their smaller teams. Team working agreements embrace that tension to
provide a framework for converting tension into healthy culture.</p>

<p>Artsy Engineering is part of a larger organization we call PDDE (Product, Design, Data, and Engineering). PDDE is
divided into several product teams, and each team contains at least one representative from product, design, data,
and engineering. Each PDDE team delivers product solutions targeted to a specific product need.</p>

<p>Until recently, those teams could expect a significant change in team members at the start of every quarter, as we
encouraged engineers to explore other teams. The purpose of this practice was to spread knowledge throughout the
organization, and give folks the opportunity to keep themselves aligned with projects they found most interesting.</p>

<p>The downside of this practice was that it made teams feel short-lived, impermanent, and unstable. Some teams were
hit harder than others - they'd see their team completely turn over every quarter. This was felt most strongly by
our product managers who would take the time to learn the skills and strengths of each engineer on their team over
the course of a quarter, just to have to start the process all over again, making it difficult to plan projects or
set goals for the following quarter.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, PDDE decided to set the expectation that engineers would stay on the same team each
quarter, with the option to request a team change, when necessary, to fill a skill, capacity, or growth need
elsewhere. This effectively ended the practice of shuffling teams every quarter. It was too much change, too often.</p>

<p>As a result, our teams feel more stable and long-lived. We're able to build deeper team identity. We've found one
tool particularly helpful in finding and building team identity: team working agreements.</p>

<a name="How.did.team.working.agreements.come.about.at.Artsy."></a>
<h2>How did team working agreements come about at Artsy?</h2>

<p>The current breakdown of our PDDE organization is relatively new; it's also an on-going process. We are still
feeling out how these teams will/should work together. One of the core beliefs at Artsy is that when you are a part
of something - a process, a team, a culture - you are empowered to make impactful changes to it.</p>

    <p class="intro">Adam Iskounen says...</p>
    <p>
      Team cohesion and unity was a common theme that kept surfacing during the retrospective meeting that led to
      PDDE ending the quarterly shuffling of teams. During my onboarding, I noticed in retros that teams were
      strong on "what went well" and light on "what could be improved." We'd have 1 or 2 "didn't go well" tickets,
      but they were usually something light-hearted/benign like "team lunch was cancelled". One team in particular
      seemed like they were dancing around each other a bit, and important things like "not getting stuff done"
      wasn't being brought up.
    </p>
    <p>I remembered that team working agreements were a tool used by
      a scrum master at my previous job to help a particular team that was struggling to gel, and brought it up
      without really knowing what was involved in the process. Fortunately my product manager - who was eager to
      form a team where each member felt empowered and excited to take ownership of our work - encouraged me to
      research and share the process for coming up with a team working agreement. At first I was nervous that some
      team members, especially those who I perceived to be more interested in technical challenges than on team-building,
      would not be interested in this and find that it was a waste of time. I was pleasantly surprised that not only did
      everyone on the team participate, but that those team members ended up being some of the more enthusiastic
      proponents for following-up on the team working agreement after our initial brainstorm.
    </p>
  </div>
</aside></p>

<p>Since being pioneered by Adam's team, team working agreements have spread to most of our engineering teams. They've
been a learning opportunity for all of us, and a chance for our team members to share experiences and practices
with each other.</p>

<a name="What.s.a.team.working.agreement."></a>
<h2>What's a team working agreement?</h2>

<p>A team working agreement is a written set of guidelines for an engineering team. It enumerates the habits and
practices that the team requires to be productive and successful. The agreement is a living document, and every
member of the team has a part in shaping it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development">According to Bruce Tuckman, a team moves through four phases of development: forming, storming, norming, and performing</a>.
Team working agreements can help a team move more quickly through the stages. A team in the "forming" stage will
quickly uncover areas of disagreement and move to "storming" when they attempt to align on a working agreement. A
"storming" team might move to "norming" more quickly when their points of friction are arbitrated in a working
agreement.</p>

<p>Examples of habits or practices on a team working agreement might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any change to the sprint backlog requires product manager approval.</li>
<li>Everyone owns the backlog and should add tickets for untracked work.</li>
<li>Update the backlog before each day’s standup.</li>
</ul>


<p>We've been using a fairly consistent process to develop team working agreements at Artsy.</p>

<a name="Step.1:.Educate.the.team.about.team.working.agreements"></a>
<h3>Step 1: Educate the team about team working agreements</h3>

<p>We want every team member to recognize the importance of creating an agreement.</p>

<p>Each team reviews
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/playbooks/agile/team-working-agreement.md">our docs on the process of creating a working agreement</a>
before creating one. They might also review an existing working agreement.</p>

<a name="Step.2:.Conduct.a.brainstorming.meeting"></a>
<h3>Step 2: Conduct a brainstorming meeting</h3>

<p>The team meets for an hour to brainstorm ideas that promote success from each individual or the team as a whole.
Some of our teams have met fully in-person and used physical sticky notes for brainstorming; many have used an
online tool like <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro</a> to include remote members.</p>

<p>It's vital that <em>all</em> members of the team attend the brainstorm. For us, that includes engineers and product
managers, but also designers and data analysts. This is a discussion of how the entire team works together -
everyone's voice should be heard.</p>

<p>A sample brainstorm agenda is
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/playbooks/agile/team-working-agreement.md#sample-meeting-agenda">shared in our docs</a>.
The output of the brainstorm is a set of ideas that everyone has contributed to.</p>

<a name="Step.3:.Distill.brainstorming.ideas.into.discrete..digestible.habits"></a>
<h3>Step 3: Distill brainstorming ideas into discrete, digestible habits</h3>

<p>The ideas from the brainstorming process can be sorted into themes. Within themes, we work to condense ideas into
habits and practices that are agreeable to the entire team. We have found success in keeping the language for these
habits small, discrete, and slogan-like.</p>

<p>The distillation step might take several round-trips of gathering feedback and wordsmith-ing.</p>

<a name="Step.4:.Commit.the.most.important.habits.to.a..Team.Working.Agreement..document"></a>
<h3>Step 4: Commit the most important habits to a "Team Working Agreement" document</h3>

<p>The team votes on which habits should be included in the agreement and a document is circulated.</p>

<p>It's not done, though. Remember: it's a living document.</p>

<a name="Step.5:.Revisit.the.working.agreement"></a>
<h3>Step 5: Revisit the working agreement</h3>

<p>As a team, decide how often the agreement should be revisited, and what "revisiting the agreement" means. When
should we amend it? When should we do another brainstorm? It probably doesn't make sense to scrap the old agreement
when one new team member joins, but how much change on a team would inspire us to recreate our agreement?</p>

<a name="Why.establish.a.team.working.agreement."></a>
<h2>Why establish a team working agreement?</h2>

<a name="The.brainstorm.itself.is.incredibly.valuable."></a>
<h3>The brainstorm itself is incredibly valuable.</h3>

<p>Dedicated time to talk about values, habits, and processes is incredibly helpful to a team, yet rarely scheduled.
The brainstorm for a team working agreement can fill this void.</p>

<p>During the team agreement brainstorm the team looks at <em>how</em> they work, instead of looking at <em>what</em> work they're
doing. It's similar to what you might get out of a retro but at a higher level. It offers time to discuss "soft"
skills that you don't often discuss, in a context that you don't usually discuss them - with other individual
contributors, and with your closest collaborators.</p>

<p><aside class="dialogue">
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/dialogue/steve.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Steve Hicks says...</p>
    <p>
      When joining a new team, there's often a period of "feeling it out" - where I'm afraid to verbalize an
      opinion because I'm not sure how the team feels about it. The team working agreement process has definitely
      helped lessen this feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTXf6qyaGk">great talk by Katherine Wu named "Ask vs Guess Culture"</a>.
      "Guess" culture is when you try to guess what a person wants or is thinking; "Ask" culture is when you flat out
      ask them. Team agreement brainstorms are a really neat way to <em>ask</em> your team how they want to work, instead of
      spending many sprints trying to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, I have seen the most value out of <em>the actual brainstorm</em> than the working agreement itself. My teams
      have learned so much about each others' habits and values.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/dialogue/adam.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Adam Iskounen says...</p>
    <p>
      The process has helped confirm that the team shared interest in team dynamics &amp; the process of collaboration
      across the team. As a new member it's nice to know that information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's been great to see teammates bring up the team agreement in different contexts. It wasn't just a one-hour
      brainstorm, it's something our team is living. Hearing our slogan-like habits recited during team meetings
      long after the brainstorm is a testament to the value of the agreement.
    </p>
  </div>
</aside></p>

<a name="It.can.lead.to.better.engagement.in.sprint.activities."></a>
<h3>It can lead to better engagement in sprint activities.</h3>

<p>One of our teams established in their working agreement that sprint meetings were valuable. This might seem too
obvious to put in a team working agreement, but it portrays clearly to everyone that they should attend all sprint
meetings and be actively engaged.</p>

<p>The same team got a lot out of making slogans for the items in their working agreement. Phrases like "Pair by
default" and "Incremental improvement over consistency" were introduced during the brainstorm. They've since become
mantras for the team to refer to during sprint work and ceremonies. Team values and habits solidify through this
kind of repetition.</p>

<a name="The.team.working.agreement.provides.on-boarding.documentation."></a>
<h3>The team working agreement provides on-boarding documentation.</h3>

<p>When new members join a team, it takes time for them to adjust. A team working agreement provides an up-to-date
reference on the team's preferred methods of working. The working agreement isn't set in stone, and as the team
changes it's important to update it... but having it in writing helps new members acclimate quickly.</p>

<a name="What.are.some.challenges.with.team.working.agreements."></a>
<h2>What are some challenges with team working agreements?</h2>

<a name="Uncertainty.about.what.the.team.agreement.should.include."></a>
<h3>Uncertainty about what the team agreement should include.</h3>

<p>Some teams have struggled to identify what belongs on a team working agreement. Should it describe our team values?
Habits? Procedures? Rules? Favorite afternoon snacks?</p>

<p>It likely varies from team to team what you want here. Some teams might require guidance around working with JIRA;
others might be more focused on taking ownership of problems. These differences are likely a reflection of the
problems the team is currently facing or has recently faced.</p>

<p>It's definitely important that you identify what you're looking for up front, and make it clear heading into the
brainstorm. Suggest categories, sample habits, &amp; questions to ask heading into the brainstorm, and keep them
visible during the meeting.</p>

<p>Take notice of known problem areas: are they addressed or avoided in the agreement? It is easy for a team to avoid
confrontation at their own expense.</p>

<p>Also be cautious about introducing individual bias.</p>

<p><aside class="dialogue">
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/dialogue/steve.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Steve Hicks says...</p>
    <p>
      During my first team agreement brainstorm, I felt like we spent a lot of time talking about details
      related to specific incidents. On my next team, I made a strong effort to constrain the suggestions
      to avoid this. To me, team values were really important for this new team - and I did such a good
      job of encouraging those types of suggestions that it's pretty much all we ended up with.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, our initial working agreement lacked important procedural and tactical definition. We've
      been adding things like JIRA hygiene and responsibilities of project leaders as they come up, but I would
      not push a working agreement brainstorm so strongly in one direction again.
    </p>
  </div>
</aside></p>

<p>Remember that the working agreement is a living document. If the team learns that it missed something in the
brainstorm, don't hesitate to update the agreement. Team retros are a great time to make updates.</p>

<a name="Working.agreements.are.hard.to.define.for.teams.without.a.well-established.identity."></a>
<h3>Working agreements are hard to define for teams without a well-established identity.</h3>

<p>For a team that has a strong and cohesive identity, the agreement is likely to affirm many things the team is
already believing and doing. For a less cohesive team the agreement is harder to pin down. Many opinions will
surface, and they may be in conflict with each other.</p>

<p>While this is indeed challenging, it is also important to note that teams that lack identity benefit <em>greatly</em> from
the team agreement brainstorm. Provided there is
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#psychological-safety">psychological safety</a>,
this is a really great time for the team to learn about what matters to each other, and move toward establishing an
identity.</p>

<a name="Facilitating.the.brainstorm.can.be.difficult.on.a.distributed.team."></a>
<h3>Facilitating the brainstorm can be difficult on a distributed team.</h3>

<p>Some of our teams were able to brainstorm with everyone on-site. They were able to rely on post-it notes and
in-person conversations, and read each other's non-verbal communication. Other teams have a mix of on-site and
remote members, and used tools like <a href="http://miro.com/">Miro</a> to facilitate. This <em>can</em> present a challenge...but if
you're already a distributed team, they are likely the same types of challenges you've worked to overcome for <em>all</em>
meetings.</p>

<p>The differences are worth noting, though. The importance of reading each other's non-verbal communication is
magnified when you're having conversations about identity. It's quicker to organize and re-organize real-life
post-its than virtual post-its in an online tool. These are all opportunities to get better at being a distributed
team.</p>

<a name="It.takes.effort.to.make.sure.one.person.isn.t.introducing.their.bias.into.the.working.agreement."></a>
<h3>It takes effort to make sure one person isn't introducing their bias into the working agreement.</h3>

<p>It's important for the team agreement brainstorm to provide an environment in which every team member is heard.
Even if your team is successful at this, there are still opportunities for individual bias to affect the working
agreement.</p>

<p>We saw earlier how bias can appear when the examples provided for the brainstorm are too narrowly scoped.</p>

<p>We recognized another bias vector in the distillation of the brainstorm into an actual agreement. If this is
handled by a single person, it's very possible for them to produce a working agreement that misrepresents <em>the
rest</em> of the team. To counter this, we've had multiple team members pair on the distillation process. Feedback on
the initial draft of the agreement is also important to ensure it does not misrepresent the team's ideas.</p>

<p>The problem of introducing bias to the distillation process is most challenging with topics that are disputed
across the team. One of our teams spent a lot of time talking about meetings in their brainstorm, but struggled to
come to consensus on them. No single person, or even a pair, could add a disputed topic like this to the working
agreement without introducing their personal bias. In this specific case, the team chose to leave meetings off the
working agreement until they could reach consensus. Topics that are disputed across the team are important to talk
about at <em>some</em> point, but the brainstorm is probably not the time.</p>

<a name="Team.health.is.easy.to.postpone.when.you.have.important.product.work.to.do."></a>
<h3>Team health is easy to postpone when you have important product work to do.</h3>

<p>One of our teams put the act of distilling the brainstorm notes into an agreement on one person. That person became
busier than expected, didn't have time to write the agreement, and the team's agreement stalled.</p>

<p>Just as personal self-care gets put on the back burner during stressful times, creating a working agreement is easy
to bump down the backlog during intense periods of sprint work. The longer a team drags out the working agreement
process, the more context is lost from the original brainstorm. We recommend not letting your working agreement
linger.</p>

<p>It's also important to revisit the working agreement often. It is a living document, not one-and-done. Review the
agreement as a team occasionally; update the agreement as your team learns how to collaborate better; cultivate the
agreement. If an agreement gets stale, it will become inaccurate, meaningless, and unused.</p>

<a name="What.does.it.even.mean.to.have.a.team.working.agreement."></a>
<h3>What does it even mean to have a team working agreement?</h3>

<p>A team working agreement is a neat artifact. The brainstorm process has great value. But there is non-obvious work
involved in turning a team working agreement into the team culture. We have many questions that we aren't sure how
to answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do you enforce the agreement?</li>
<li><em>Should</em> you enforce the agreement?</li>
<li>How do you get the entire team to embrace it?</li>
<li>What happens when the agreement is violated or disrespected?</li>
</ul>


<p>If you're using working agreements on your team and you've got answers for us, or you want to start using them and
have more questions, we'd love to hear from you!</p>
