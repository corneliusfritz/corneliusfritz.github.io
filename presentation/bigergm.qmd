## Plan: [bigergm workshop](https://www.corneliusfritz.com/bigergm){preview-link="true"}

1.  Short Recap: Local dependence via nonoverlapping blocks
2.  Preparation and Background
3.  Demonstration of capabilities of the package `bigergm`
4.  Hand-on part: Application to Twitter Following Network of State
    Legislators

# Short Recap: <br> Local dependence via nonoverlapping blocks

## Motivation

-   Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) model the probability of
    observing a network as a function of network statistics.

$$
 \mathbb{P}_{\beta}(\mathbf{y}| \mathbf{x}) = \exp\left(\beta^\top \mathbf{s}(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x})\right)/ c(\beta, \mathbf{x})
$$ where

-   network $\mathbf{y} = \{0,1\}^{N\times N}$
-   $p$ covariates $\mathbf{x} = (x_{i,p}) \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times q}$
-   $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p$ parameters
-   $\mathbf{s}(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x})$ sufficient statistics
-   $c(\beta, \mathbf{x})$ normalizing constant

## Limitations when applied to large networks

-   Scalable model vs. scalable method
-   Computational cost of model fitting
-   Model degeneracy <br> $\Rightarrow$ Local dependence <br>

## Exponential Random Graph Models for Large Networks

![](bigergm_files/plot_network_blocks.png){.absolute top="100"
left="250" width="600"}

## Exponential Random Graph Models for Large Networks

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbb{P}_\theta(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}) = &\left[\prod_{k \neq l}^K \mathbb{P}_{B}(\mathbf{y}_{k,l} | \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x})\right] \left[\prod_{k = 1}^K \mathbb{P}_{W}(\mathbf{y}_{k,k} | \mathbf{z},\mathbf{x}) \right]
\end{split}
$$ where

-   $\mathbf{y}_{k,l}$ is the submatrix of $\mathbf{Y}$ between blocks
    $k$ and $l$
-   $\mathbf{y}_{k,k}$ is the submatrix of $\mathbf{Y}$ within block $k$
-   $\mathbf{z}$ is the block structure of the network
-   $\mathbf{x}$ is the covariate matrix
-   $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the parameters

## Specification: Within-block Model

$$
\mathbb{P}_{W}(\mathbf{y}_{k,k} | \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}) = \exp\left(\alpha^\top \mathbf{s}_W(\mathbf{y}_{k,k}, \mathbf{x})\right)/ c_W(\alpha, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}),
$$

where

-   $\mathbf{s}_W(\mathbf{y}_{k,k}, \mathbf{x})$ is a vector of
    sufficient statistics counting, e.g., the edges within block $k$
-   $\alpha$ parameter to estimate
-   $c_W(\alpha, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x})$ is the normalizing constant

![Shared
Partner](bigergm_files/statistics_no_caption_3.png){.absolute top="450" left="650" width="250"}

## Specification: Between-block Model

$$
\mathbb{P}_{B}(\mathbf{y}_{k,l} | \mathbf{z},  \mathbf{x})  = \prod_{(i,j) \text{; } z_{ik} = 1 \text{, } z_{jl} = 1} \mathbb{P}_{\beta}( y_{i,j}  \mid \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}), 
$$
where 
$$
\mathbb{P}_{\beta}( y_{i,j} | \mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}) = (\pi_{k,l}(\beta, \mathbf{x}))^{y_{i,j}} (1 - \pi_{k,l}(\beta, \mathbf{x}))^{1 - y_{i,j}}
$$ 
e.g., 

$$
\pi_{k,l}(\beta, \mathbf{x}) = \text{logit}^{-1}\left(\beta + \sum_{p = 1}^P \beta_p \, \mathbb{I}\left(x_{i,p} = x_{j,p}\right) \right)
$$


## Specification: Between-block Model

$$
\mathbb{P}_{B}(\mathbf{y}_{k,l} | \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}) = \exp\left(\beta^\top \mathbf{s}_B(\mathbf{y}_{k,l}, \mathbf{x})\right)/ c_B(\beta, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}),
$$ 
where 
$$
\mathbf{s}_B(\mathbf{y}_{k,l}, \mathbf{x}) = \left(\sum_{i<j} \mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}, ...,  \sum_{i<j} \mathbb{I}(x_{P,i} = x_{P,j})\, y_{i,j}\right)
$$

Remarks:

1.  Within- and between-block models can be represented by ERGMs
2.  Between-block models do not include terms that imply dependence
    between connections

## Estimation

![](bigergm_files/estimation.jpg){.absolute top="50" left="50"
width="1000"}

## Estimation

$$
\mathbf{Z} \sim \text{Multinomial}(1; \gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_K),
$$

1.  Step: Estimate the block structure $\mathbf{z}$ by a variational EM
    algorithm with MM updates (@babkin_2020 and @vu_2013)

2.  Step: Estimate the parameters $\alpha$ (a) and $\beta$ (b)
    conditional on $\mathbf{z}$ with `ergm`

## `bigergm`: Hierarchical exponential-family random graph models for big networks

1.  Model specification
2.  Simulate from the model
3.  Estimate the model
4.  Diagnose the fit

# 1. Model Specification

## Specification of a HERGM

Assume the block memberships are known and specify two ERGMs:

1.  Within-block ERGM (drawn in blue)
2.  Between-block ERGM (drawn in yellow)

![](bigergm_files/block_structure.jpg){.absolute top="260" left="200"
width="700"}

## Specification of a HERGM

Assume the block memberships saved as a vertex attribute 'block':

```{r, echo = TRUE}
model_formula <- lhs_network ~ network_term_1 + ... + network_term_p
```

1.  `lhs_network`: A `network` object where the simulation should be
    started. States the size of the network and whether it's directed or
    not.
2.  `network_term(s)`: `ergmTerms` specifying the network model.
    -   Within-block ERGM: All provided terms are included and evaluated
        for each within-block subnetwork.
    -   Between-block ERGM: Only terms that imply dependence between
        connections are included and evaluated for each between-block
        subnetwork.


## Specification of a HERGM: Example 1

```{r, echo = TRUE}
model_formula <- network_tmp ~ edges   + nodematch("x") + nodematch("y")
```

Within-block model: 
$$
\mathbf{s}_W(\mathbf{y}_{k,k}, \mathbf{x}) = \left(\sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,k}\, y_{i,j}, \sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,k}\,\mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}, \sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,k}\,\mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}\right)
$$ 
Between-block model: 
$$
\mathbf{s}_B(\mathbf{y}_{k,l}, \mathbf{x}) = \left(\sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,l}\,y_{i,j}, \sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,l}\,\mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}, \sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,l}\,\mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}\right)
$$

## Specification of a HERGM: Example 2

```{r, echo = TRUE}
model_formula <- network_tmp ~ edges + nodematch("x") + nodematch("y") + transitiveties
```

Within-block model: 
$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{s}_W(\mathbf{y}_{k,k}, \mathbf{x}) = \Bigg(&\sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,k}\,y_{i,j}, \sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,k}\,\mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}, \sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,k}\,\mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}, \\ 
&\sum_{i<j} y_{i,j}\,\mathbb{I} \Bigg(\sum_{h \neq i,j} a_{i,j,h}^{k,k}\, y_{i,h}\, y_{h,j}>0 \Bigg)\Bigg)
\end{split}
$$

Between-block model:
$$
\mathbf{s}_B(\mathbf{y}_{k,l}, \mathbf{x}) = \left(\sum_{i<j}a_{i,j}^{k,l}\, y_{i,j}, \sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,l}\,\mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}, \sum_{i<j} a_{i,j}^{k,l}\,\mathbb{I}(x_{1,i} = x_{1,j})\, y_{i,j}\right)
$$

# 2. Model Simulation

## Model Simulation

1.  Specify the base network

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Load the needed packages
library(bigergm)
library(network)
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
# Specify base network (which has 200 nodes and is undirected)
network_tmp <- network::network.initialize(n = 200, directed = FALSE)
# Assign a block membership to each node 
network_tmp%v% "block" <- sample(1:4, 200, replace = TRUE)
# Assign a covariate 'x' and 'y' to each node
network_tmp%v% "x" <- sample(1:5, 200, replace = TRUE)
network_tmp%v% "y" <- sample(c("A","B","C"), 200, replace = TRUE)

  coef_between = c(-4.7,0.8, 0.4),
  # The coefficients for the within connections
  coef_within = c(-2.5,1,1,0.5),
  # Number of simulations
  nsim = 1, 
  # Control argument to guide simulation

#| fig-height: 15
plot(sim_net, vertex.col = sim_net %v% "block")
```

# 3. Model Estimation

## Model Fitting with unknown block structure

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# Update the formula to refer to the simulated network 
model_formula <- update(model_formula, sim_net~.)
res <-bigergm(
  # The model you would like to estimate
  object = model_formula,
  # The number of blocks
  n_blocks =  4, 
  # The maximum number of MM algorithm steps
  n_MM_step_max = 100,
  # The tolarence for the MM algorithm
  tol_MM_step = 1e-6,
  # Perform parameter estimation after the block recovery step
  estimate_parameters = TRUE,
  # Indicate that clustering must take into account nodematch on x and y
  clustering_with_features = TRUE,
  # Keep track of block memberships at each iteration
  check_block_membership = TRUE
)
```

## Model Fitting with unknown block structure

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
summary(res)
```

Ground truth coefficients:

-   Within-block: -2.5 (edges), 1 (nm.x), 1 (nm.y), 0.5 (tt)
-   Between-block: -4.7 (edges), 0.8 (nm.x), 0.4 (nm.y

## Model Fitting with unknown block structure

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
#| fig-width: 15
#| fig-height: 15
plot(res)
```

## Model Fitting with unknown block structure

-   Compare the found block structure with the true block structure by
    the adjusted rand index

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
ari(res$block, sim_net %v% "block")
```

-   Check the clustering step for convergence

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
#| fig-width: 15
#| fig-height: 4
plot(res$MM_lower_bound, type = "l", xlab = "Iteration", ylab = "Lower Bound", 
     main = "Convergence of the MM algorithm")
```

## Model Fitting with known block structure

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
res_known <-bigergm(
  # The model you would like to estimate
  object = model_formula,
  # Specify the block structure
  blocks = sim_net %v% "block",
  # The maximum number of MM algorithm steps
  n_MM_step_max = 100,
  # The tolarence for the MM algorithm
  tol_MM_step = 1e-6,
  # Perform parameter estimation after the block recovery step
  estimate_parameters = TRUE,
  # Indicate that clustering must take into account nodematch on x and y
  clustering_with_features = TRUE,
  # Keep track of block memberships at each iteration
  check_block_membership = TRUE
)
```

-   Within-block: -2.5 (edges), 1 (nm.x), 1 (nm.y), 0.5 (tt)
-   Between-block: -4.7 (edges), 0.8 (nm.x), 0.4 (nm.y

# 3. Model Diagnostics

## Model Diagnostics

- Check if simulations from the estimated model correspond to the observed network 
- Function calculates degree, edgewise-shared partner, and geodesic distance statistics


```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
tmp <- gof(res_known, 
    # Control argument to guide simulation
    control_within = ergm::control.simulate.formula(MCMC.burnin = 50000, 
                                                    MCMC.interval = 10000), 
    # How many simulations should be performed?
    nsim = 100,
    # Either 'full' or 'within' to say if gof should be based on only within-connections or all
    type = "full",
    # Seed for reproducibility
    seed = 123,
    # Should the simulation start from the observed network?
    start_from_observed = TRUE, 
    # Should all geodesic distances be computed for the simulated networks?
    compute_geodesic_distance = TRUE)
```

## 2. Model Estimation

- Support for parallel computation and ML estimation for within-block model

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}

  # The number of blocks
  n_MM_step_max = 1000,tol_MM_step = 0.0001,
  # The maximum number of MM algorithm steps
  estimate_parameters = TRUE,
  # Perform parameter estimation after the block recovery step
  clustering_with_features = TRUE,
  # Indicate that clustering must take into account nodematch on characteristics
  check_block_membership = TRUE, 
  # How many blocks should be estimated?
  n_blocks = 50,
  # Which estimation for the within-block model should be used?
  method_within = "MLE",
  # Control argument to guide simulation
  control_within = control.ergm(parallel=5, parallel.type="PSOCK", 
                                MCMC.burnin = 10000, 
                                MCMC.interval = 20000))
```

## 2. Model Estimation

- Homophily based on party affiliation
- Strong reciprocity effect that gets smaller for bigger networks


```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
summary(twitter_res)
```
## 2. Model Estimation

-   Exploit that `est_within` is an `ergm` object
-   Check if the MCMC chains used for estimation have converged

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
mcmc.diagnostics(twitter_res$est_within)
```
