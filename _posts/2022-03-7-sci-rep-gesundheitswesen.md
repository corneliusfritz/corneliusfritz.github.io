Two papers I was involved on just got accepted *Combining Graph Neural Networks and Spatio-temporal Disease Models to Predict COVID-19 Cases in Germany* with [David RÃ¼gamer](https://davidruegamer.github.io/) and Emilio Dorigatti was just accepted in Scientific Reports. The paper is in press but already available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00661).  Additionally, a paper written in german was accepted in Das Gesundheutswesen (similarily the article is only available in press but will soon be online). Finally, a new working paper is out on ArXiv about modelling large bipartite networks (see this [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09744)).
