I will present a joint work with [Chris Kolb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-kolb/?originalSubdomain=de) and [Prof Klein](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/en/professuren/vwl/statistik/team/kleinadj) on a new unifying method to combine structured additive models and deep neural networks to learn arbitrary distributions at the Institutskolloquium, Department of Statistics, LMU Munich on 26th of February.
