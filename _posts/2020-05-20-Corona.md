Due to Covid-19 we unfortunetaly had to cancel the [useR satelitte event](https://user2020muc.r-project.org/) in Munich, but we will move to a virtual conference! Also we had to cancel our session on advances in deep distributional regression on the EcoSta this July. 

In the hope that Covid-19 is controllable in August, we are currently planning a workshop on Uncertainty Quantification together with the [AI4EO Lab of Prof. Zhu](https://www.lrg.tum.de/flr/organisation/aktuelles/article/ai4eo-zukunftslabor-fuer-kuenstliche-intelligenz/) and researchers from the Fraunhofer institute.
