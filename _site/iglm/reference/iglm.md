# Construct an iglm Model Specification Object

`R` package `iglm` implements generalized linear models (GLMs) for
studying relationships among attributes in connected populations, where
responses of connected units can be dependent. It extends GLMs for
independent responses to dependent responses and can be used for
studying spillover in connected populations and other network-mediated
phenomena. It is based on a joint probability model for dependent
responses (\\Y\\) and connections \\(Z)\\ conditional on predictors (X).

## Usage

``` r
iglm(
  formula = NULL,
  coef = NULL,
  coef_degrees = NULL,
  sampler = NULL,
  control = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  file = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- formula:

  A model \`formula\` object. The left-hand side should be the name of a
  \`iglm.data\` object available in the calling environment. See
  [`iglm-terms`](iglm-terms.md) for details on specifying the right-hand
  side terms.

- coef:

  Optional numeric vector of initial coefficients for the structural
  (non-degrees) terms in \`formula\`. If \`NULL\`, coefficients are
  initialized to zero. Length must match the number of terms.

- coef_degrees:

  Optional numeric vector specifying the initial degrees coefficients.
  Required if \`formula\` includes degrees terms, otherwise should be
  \`NULL\`. Length must match \`n_actor\` (for undirected) or \`2 \*
  n_actor\` (for directed).

- sampler:

  An object of class [`sampler.iglm`](sampler.iglm.md), controlling the
  MCMC sampling scheme. If \`NULL\`, default sampler settings will be
  used.

- control:

  An object of class [`control.iglm`](control.iglm.md), specifying
  parameters for the estimation algorithm. If \`NULL\`, default control
  settings will be used.

- name:

  Optional character string specifying a name for the model.

- file:

  Optional character string specifying a file path to load a previously
  saved `iglm.object` from disk (in RDS format). If provided, other
  arguments are ignored and the object is loaded from the file.

## Value

An object of class `iglm.object`.

## Model Formulation

The joint probability density is specified as \$\$f\_{\theta}(y,z,x)
\propto \Big\[\prod\_{i=1}^{N} a_x(x_i)\\ a_y(y_i) \exp(\theta_g^T
\mathbf{g}\_i(x_i^\*, y_i^\*)) \Big\] \times \Big\[\prod\_{i \ne j}
a_z(z\_{i,j}) \exp(\theta_h^T \mathbf{h}\_{i,j}(x_i^\*,x_j^\*, y_i^\*,
y_j^\*, z)) \Big\],\$\$ which is defined by two distinct sets of
user-specified features:

- **\\\mathbf{g}\_i(x_i^\*, y_i^\*)= (g_i(x_i^\*, y_i^\*))\\**: A vector
  of unit-level functions (or "g-terms") that describe the relationship
  between an individual actor \\i\\'s predictors (\\x_i\\) and their own
  response (\\y_i\\).

- **\\\mathbf{h}\_{i,j}(x_i^\*,x_j^\*, y_i^\*, y_j^\*, z)=
  (h\_{i,j}(x_i^\*,x_j^\*, y_i^\*, y_j^\*, z))\\**: A vector of
  pair-level functions (or "h-terms") that specify how the connections
  (\\z\\) and responses (\\y_i, y_j\\) of a pair of units \\\\i,j\\\\
  depend on each other and the wider network structure.

This separation allows the model to simultaneously capture
individual-level behavior (via \\g_i\\) and dyadic, network-based
dependencies (via \\h\_{i,j}\\), including local dependence limited to
overlapping neighborhoods. This help page documents the various
statistics available in 'iglm', corresponding to the \\g_i\\
(attribute-level) and \\h\_{i,j}\\ (pair-level) components of the joint
model. See [`iglm-terms`](iglm-terms.md) for details on specifying all
model terms via the formula interface.
