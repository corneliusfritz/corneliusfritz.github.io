# Model specification for a \`iglm' object

`R` package `iglm` implements generalized linear models (GLMs) for
studying relationships among attributes in connected populations, where
responses of connected units can be dependent. It extends GLMs for
independent responses to dependent responses and can be used for
studying spillover in connected populations and other network-mediated
phenomena. It is based on a joint probability model for dependent
responses (\\Y\\) and connections \\(Z)\\ conditional on predictors (X).

The joint probability density is specified as \$\$f\_{\theta}(y,z,x)
\propto \Big\[\prod\_{i=1}^{N} a_y(y_i) \exp(\theta_g^T g_i(x_i,
y_i^\*)) \Big\] \times \Big\[\prod\_{i \ne j} a_z(z\_{i,j})
\exp(\theta_h^T h\_{i,j}(x, y_i^\*, y_j^\*, z)) \Big\],\$\$ which is
defined by two distinct sets of user-specified features:

- **\\g_i(x,y,z)\\**: A vector of unit-level functions (or "g-terms")
  that describe the relationship between an individual actor \\i\\'s
  predictors (\\x_i\\) and their own response (\\y_i\\).

- **\\h\_{i,j}(x,y,z)\\**: A vector of pair-level functions (or
  "h-terms") that specify how the connections (\\z\\) and responses
  (\\y_i, y_j\\) of a pair of units \\\\i,j\\\\ depend on each other and
  the wider network structure.

This separation allows the model to simultaneously capture
individual-level behavior (via \\g_i\\) and dyadic, network-based
dependencies (via \\h\_{i,j}\\), including local dependence limited to
overlapping neighborhoods. This help page documents the various
statistics available in 'iglm', corresponding to the \\g_i\\
(attribute-level) and \\h\_{i,j}\\ (pair-level) components of the joint
model. In the formula interface, these terms can be specified by adding
them in the right-hand side of a model formula, e.g.,
`iglm.data ~ attribute_x + edges(mode = "local") + popularity, ...`. See
the documentation for [`iglm`](iglm.md) for details on model fitting and
estimation.

## Details

Each term defines a component for the model's features, which are a sum
of unit-level components, \\\sum_i g_i(x,y,z)\\, and/or pair-level
components, \\\sum\_{i \ne j} h\_{i,j}(x,y,z)\\. Here, \\x_i\\ and
\\y_i\\ are the attributes for actor \\i\\, and \\z\_{i,j}\\ indicates
the presence (1) or absence (0) of a tie from actor \\i\\ to actor
\\j\\. The local neighborhood of actor \\i\\ is denoted
\\\mathcal{N}\_i\\, and the indicator for whether actors \\i\\ and \\j\\
share a local neighborhood is given by \\c\_{i,j} =
\mathbb{I}(\mathcal{N}\_i \cap \mathcal{N}\_j \neq \emptyset)\\. The
functions below specify the forms of \\g_i(x,y,z)\\ and
\\h\_{i,j}(x,y,z)\\ for each term. Some terms also depend on other
covariates, which are denoted by \\v = (v_1, ..., v_N)\\ (unit-level)
and \\w = (w\_{i,j}) \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}\\(dyadic). These
covariates must be provided by the user via the `data` argument. The
implemented terms are grouped into three categories:

1.  \\g_i\\ terms for attribute dependence,

2.  \\h\_{i,j}\\ terms for network dependence,

3.  \\h\_{i,j}\\ Terms for joint attribute/network dependence.

- **1. \\g_i\\ Terms for Attribute Dependence**:

- `attribute_x`:

  **Attribute (X) \[g-term\]:** Intercept for attribute 'x'.
  \\g_i(x,y,z) = x_i\\

- `attribute_y`:

  \\g_i(x,y,z) = y_i\\

- `cov_x`:

  **Nodal Covariate (X) \[g-term\]:** Effect of a unit-level covariate
  \\v_i\\ on attribute \\x_i\\. \\g_i(x,y,z) = v_i x_i\\

- `cov_y(data = v)`:

  **Nodal Covariate (Y) \[g-term\]:** Effect of a unit-level covariate
  \\v_i\\ on attribute \\y_i\\. \\g_i(x,y,z) = v_i y_i\\

  attributes \\x_i\\ and \\y_i\\ on the same node. For mode different
  from "global", we count interactions of an actor's attributes with
  their local neighbors' attributes.

  network. Estimation of popularity effects is carried out using a MM
  algorithm. For directed networks, each actors has a sender and

  identifiability). For undirected networks, each actor has a single
  popularity effect.
